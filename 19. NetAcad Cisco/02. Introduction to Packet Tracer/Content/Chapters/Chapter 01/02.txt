Overview of packet tracer

Cisco Packet Tracer is an innovative network simulation and visualization tool. This free software helps you to practice your network configuration and troubleshooting skills via your 
desktop computer or an Android or iOS based mobile device. Packet Tracer is available for both the Linux and Windows desktop environments.

With Packet Tracer you can choose to build a network from scratch, use a pre-built sample network, or complete classroom lab assignments. Packet Tracer allows you to easily explore how 
data traverses your network. Packet Tracer provides an easy way to design and build networks of varying sizes without expensive lab equipment. While this software is not a replacement for 
practicing on physical routers, switches, firewalls, and servers, it provides too many benefits to ignore!
