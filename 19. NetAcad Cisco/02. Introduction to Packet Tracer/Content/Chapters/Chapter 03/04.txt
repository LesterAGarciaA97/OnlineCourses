Viewing the contents of PDUs


Once the PDUs have been captured, you have several ways to view their contents. Viewing the contents of the PDUs can be used to verify connectivity, verify functionality, and troubleshoot 
issues. It is also a great tool for studying or reviewing the contents of the OSI model layers and the mechanisms of communication.

If viewed in OSI Model mode, you see a summary of the addresses and contents of the headers at each layer. If you select Inbound or Outbound PDU Details, the exact format of the 
appropriate headers is displayed.
