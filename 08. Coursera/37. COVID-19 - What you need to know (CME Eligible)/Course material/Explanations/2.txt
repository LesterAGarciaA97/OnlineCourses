Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Reverse-Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR): Quiz Explanations

#1 Which of the following describes the role of polymerase chain reaction?

    To increase the amount of genetic material present
    To decrease the amount of genetic material present
    To increase the amount of viral protein present
    To decrease the amount of viral protein present

Explanation: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a molecular biology technique used to amplify or increase the amount of genetic material present.

#2 What are the three key steps that occur in a full cycle of PCR?

    Entry, replication, and budding
    Heating, latching, and cooling
    Denaturation, annealing, and extension
    Entry, replication, and budding

Explanation: The three key steps in a cycle of PCR are denaturation of double-stranded DNA, annealing of primers to the single-stranded DNA, and extension of single-stranded DNA by Taq polymerase to become double-stranded DNA.

#3 In addition to the steps needed in PCR, what is an additional step that's required in RT-PCR?

    Reverse transcriptase generates RNA from cDNA
    Reverse transcriptase generates cDNA from RNA
    Taq polymerase generates RNA from cDNA
    Taq polymerase generates cDNA from RNA.

Explanation:In RT-PCR the additional step is that reverse transcriptase first generates cDNA from RNA, and then the steps of PCR are followed.
