Class Creation in Object Oriented Python

Now we will work on Python and Classes. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

    Create the Class definition based on requirements.
    Create the Constructor to allow us to create objects with data.
    Add Getters and Setters to access and modify the attributes.
    Add a String representation of the object for output.
    Sort a list of objects.

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. 
This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
