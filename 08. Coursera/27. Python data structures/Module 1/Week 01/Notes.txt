List, Set, Tuple, Dictionary

List, Set and Dictionary are multiple
Tuple is inmutable, once created cannot be modified

Set is similar to a list, but cannot contain duplicates

Dictionary is used to store keyvalue pairs

Task1: Read file into list
1. A list is one of the mutable data structures
2.Populate a List from a comma separated file
3. Print the list

Task2: Use a set
1. The set is another mutable data structure
2. Similar to a list, but no duplicates are allowed
3. Use the list to create a set
4. Write the set to a file

Task3: Create Dictionary
1. A dictionary is mutable
2. A tuple is inmutable
3. Create a function to return a tuple-word and
   definition from the list
4. Use the function to populate the Dictionary


Task4: Create List
1. Write a function to retrieve a definition and word from de Dictionary
2. Return the word and definition as a tuple
3. Get the set of keys from the Dictionary; the word list

Task5: Use Tuple
1. Implement a While Loop to present words, definition choices
2. Use the function to retrieve the word, definition tuple from the dictionary
3. Shuffle the choices
4. Present the word and choices to the user
5. Check the answer
