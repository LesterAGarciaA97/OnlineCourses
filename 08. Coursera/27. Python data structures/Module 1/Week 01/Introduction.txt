Python Data Structures

Now we will work on Python data structures. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

    Read the CSV file into a List Data Structure
    Uniquify the data using the Set Data Structure
    Create the Dictionary of Words and Definitions
    Create a word List based on the set of Keys
    Create the quiz using function that returns a Tuple.

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. 
This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
