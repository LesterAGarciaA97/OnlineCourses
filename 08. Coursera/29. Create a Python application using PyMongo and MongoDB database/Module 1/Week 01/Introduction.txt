Python and MongoDB

Now we will work on Python and MongoDB. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

    Read the CSV file into a JSON-style List Data Structure
    Create the Database and Collection using PyMongo
    Populate the Collection with Documents using insert_one and insert_many
    Query the Collection using find_one and find
    Updating the Collection

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. 
This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
