[MUSIC] Welcome to module five,
the last module of this course. Now that above learned JavaScript language
fundamentals, we will dive into using JavaScript and manipulate elements within
our webpage as well as use AJAX to pull real data from a server, without the need
for the user to reload the entire page. We'll finish off the module by using
our newly acquired JavaScript and AJAX skills to complete the restaurant
website, so it pulls its content and menu data from the server and
dynamically generates HTML for the view. See you in the module.
