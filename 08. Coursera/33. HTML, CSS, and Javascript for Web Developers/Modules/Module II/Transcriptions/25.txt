[MUSIC] Okay, you have finished
about half the course. Congratulations. If you didn't know HTML and CSS before, or didn't know it well,
take a moment and look back. You are now way more skilled than a lot of
people who simply mess around with HTML and CSS without knowing
the foundational concepts. Take a moment and reflect. It's pretty empowering isn't it? In the next module, we'll start coding
a real website for a real client. Keep going to module three. You do not want to miss this.
