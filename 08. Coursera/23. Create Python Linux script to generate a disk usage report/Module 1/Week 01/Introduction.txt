Python Linux Script to Generate a Disk Usage Report

Now we will work on Python Linux Script. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

    Prepare the Python Script.
    Use the __name__ to identify the main code and use sys.argv to access the command line arguments.
    Create a for loop to access each sub-directory.
    Create a function to determine the disk space used by each directory.
    Use a python package to generate a report in CSV format.

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. 
This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
