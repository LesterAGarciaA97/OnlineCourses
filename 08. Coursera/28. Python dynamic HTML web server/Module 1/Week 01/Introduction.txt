Python Dynamic HTML Web Server

Now we will work on Python Dynamic HTML Web Server. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

    Use the SimpleHTTPRequestHandler to allow the Server to Handle Requests.
    Create a Home Page for the Web Application.
    Add CGI to allow Dynamic Web Pages.
    Create a Python Script to create a Time-Stamped List of Random Numbers.
    Add routing by implementing the do_GET method.

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. 
This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
