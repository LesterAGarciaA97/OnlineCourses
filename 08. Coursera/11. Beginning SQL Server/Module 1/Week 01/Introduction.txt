Building our SQL Server

Now we will build our SQL Server. We will accomplish it in Rhyme by completing each task in the project:

    Task 1: Learn to execute the USE statement to switch databases.
    Task 2: Create and then delete our very own database.
    Task 3: Create a table in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
    Task 4: Add a column to a table in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
    Task 5: Manage security permissions on databases.
