Data Visualization with Python

Now we will visualize data with Python. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

    Create a Pandas DataFrame Table
    MatPlotLib Plot
    Scatterplot Graph
    Heatmap plot
    Jointplot Distribution 

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. 
After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
