Testing and Debugging Python

Now we will test and debug with Python. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

    Create Python Code Stub
    Select Testing Framework
    Implement Function
    Debug code
    Finalize Tests

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. 
After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
