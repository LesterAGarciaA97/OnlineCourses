Finding bugs while testing is a good practice before
the application goes to production

First, it is necessary to create a function to test

Create a function stube 
a function stube is a placeholder for a function

Print is common in debugging


Select  a test framework
1. Enable a test framework-unittest
2. A test is designed with a test input and expected results based on function specs.
3. The bubble sort function should fail the test.
4. This is TDD: Test-Driven Development


Explore test output and implement the function
1. Observe the test output
2. Implement the function (dont worry to fix it)!
3. Run the test using the icons on the test itself


Debug
1. Set breakpoints -used to paused program to analyze variables
2. use the Debug controls to step through code
	Continue
	Step over
	Step into
	Step out
3. Zero in on Error
