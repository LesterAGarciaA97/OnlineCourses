Linux from the Command Line

Now we will work on Python and Classes. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

    Display the home directory from a terminal
    List files and directories using ls
    Use the cd command to change directories
    Use touch, copy, mkdir, and rm to create and remove files and directories
    Search for Files using find, Search for patterns using grep

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. 
After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
