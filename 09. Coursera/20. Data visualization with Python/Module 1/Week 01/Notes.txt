Create a Pandas dataframe table
1. A table using Pandas dataframe and print
2. Stadistics base on the table values
3. A line graph with an X axis and Y axis using Pandas
4. A window showing the graph using Matplotlib's pyplot

Matplotlib pyplot
1. A pyplot using temperature and month
2. A pyplot using Month and temperature
3. A Pyplot using month on the X axis, Temperature and Rainfall together on the Y axis.
4. Create a Legens foe the graph


Scatterplot graph
1. Introducing the Seaborn library
2. Built atop MatplotLib
3. Create a plot with individual data poir scattered
4. Create a regression to show possible correlation


Seaborn Heatmap
1. Popular type of graph--good for spotting large and small values quickly
2. Sometimes requires data to be reorganized into a Matrix using pivots
3. Has a color key on the side
4. Create using a new births data set: (month, year, number of births)

*This map is used to show correlations


JointPlot
1. Popular type graph--Good for looking at distribution and data points at the same time
2. Has option to display different kind of graph- the parameter called kind
3. Here, we will see scatter with regression line, as well as distribution
