Big-O time complexity in Python code

This is no delimeted by time, is taken by
amount of data used

 Visualize complexity results using PyPlot

1. Implement the plot function that will be used for future tasks
2. Takes an array for X-coordinates and an array for Y coordinate
3. Used in future tasks to plot input Size N on the X axis and iteration count on the Y axis
4. Create a window showing the graph using Matplotlib's pyplot
5. Determine how this will be used to visuallize Big-O


Array = Constant

Bubble sort = Ascending --> Increasing automatically

Linear search function = Linear and increasing constantly

Binary search = Ascending tending to be constant
