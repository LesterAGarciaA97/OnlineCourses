Relational Modeling in Dia

In Relational Modeling in Dia you will learn to document a database design using an Entity Relationship Diagram by completing:

ERD Revisited - You will review the components in the ERD as you familiarize yourself with the specific ERD that will be used in the database design process in this course.
Relational Model Components - In preparation for a conversion from the ERD to the Relational model, you will take a look at the components of a Relational Model and the Dia tool 
set required to create the Relational Model diagram.
Entities and Attributes - You will use Dia to create a new relational model and begin the processing of converting the entities and applicable attributes from the ERD into the model. 

Adding Tables and Primary Keys - You will continue the process of converting the entities and applicable attributes from the ERD into the Relational Model in Dia.
One-to-Many Relationships - You will use Dia to show the common columns that represent one-to-many relationships between relational tables.
Many-to-Many Relationships - You will use Dia to add a bridge table to your Relational Model to show the common columns between two tables with a many-to-many relationship.
The Complete Relational Model - You will use Dia to explore additional options for foreign keys, eventually completing the Relational Model diagram.

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. 
This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. 
After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning experiences.
