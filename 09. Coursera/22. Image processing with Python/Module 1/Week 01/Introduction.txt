Image Processing with Python

Now we will process images with Python. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

    Read the Image using Python and OpenCV
    Resize the Image using OpenCV
    Blur the Image
    Sharpen the Image
    Batch Process a Folder of Images

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. 
This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
