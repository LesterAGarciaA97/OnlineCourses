Python Pandas Merge Sort Filter

Now we will work on Python Pandas Merge Sort Filter. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

    Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
    Use a Filter to remove outliers in the data.
    Combine the data using Pandas Merge.
    Sort the data by rainfall and temperature.
    Use the Seaborn package to create a regression plot.

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. 
This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
