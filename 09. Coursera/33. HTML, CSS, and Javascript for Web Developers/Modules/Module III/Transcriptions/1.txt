[MUSIC] Welcome to module 3. This module is a real journey where
we will code a real web site for a real client from scratch. And you will get to sit right next
to me as I go through this process. We'll start with going over some tips
on how to work with your client and how to extract requirements for
you projects. Then we will dive into our main topic,
coding the website. In the previous module, we only briefly introduced
Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework. In this module, we will be learning the Bootstrap
framework as we code this real website and we'll finish off the module with testing
our completed website on a mobile phone. Pretty exciting stuff. See you in the module.
