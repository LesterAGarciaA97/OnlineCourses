[MUSIC] Congratulations on completing module 4. While I didn't cover everything there is
to know about JavaScript, since JavaScript is only one topic in this fairly short
course, we did go pretty deep, and what we did cover should give
you a very solid foundation. I would actually bet that even some
seasoned developers don't know all the topics from this module. In the next module, we'll start applying
JavaScript to creating web applications. Keep going, you only have one module left
to go and you complete the entire course.
