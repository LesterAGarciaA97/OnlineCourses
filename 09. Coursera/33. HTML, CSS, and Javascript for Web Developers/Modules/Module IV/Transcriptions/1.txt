[MUSIC] Welcome to Module Four. This module is all about
JavaScript the language. Now JavaScript is one of the most
used programming languages out there. Yet a lot of people don't
really appreciate it's power. In my personal experience, this is
largely due to the lack of understanding of the language fundamentals. I know, I was once in the same
boat as well, I admit it. This is why I believe learning
its fundamentals is crucial. Another reason why JavaScript doesn't have
such a great reputation is historical. In the early days of the web, the browsers
implemented JavaScript support much in the same way they implemented
HTML support, however they pleased. This called a lot of heartache for
developers because you couldn't be certain that your code would run in
the same way in all browsers. In addition,
JavaScript used to lack tooling and frameworks that ease the difficulties
with everyday programming. While things aren't perfect nowadays
either they're much better. There are quite a number of good editors
that support JavaScript development and a hefty number of frameworks and libraries that simplify
programming JavaScript today. One word of warning, this module assumes that you have
the basic understanding of programming. If you don't know general concepts like
variables, looping, what an if statement is and so on, you will have
a tough time getting this module. If you fall into the category I suggest
you find and go through a programming basics tutorial first then come back and
finish this module. See you in the module.
