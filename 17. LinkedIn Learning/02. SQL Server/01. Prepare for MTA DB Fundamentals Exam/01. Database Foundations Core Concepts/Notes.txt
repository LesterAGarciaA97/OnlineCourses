UNDERSTANDING DATA STORAGE MODELS

DB's are at the core of our modern technologyAre highly structures data files
allowed data input, organization and retrieval

DB management system
Program that allow the manipulation of DB's

DBMS
Structural rules
Data entry
Data protection

Retrieving data
Create one or more indexes to the data
Query the data in flexible ways (sort, filter, summarize and organize)


Flat file DB's
2 dimensional tables
made up of rows and columns
tipically stored in text files

Flat File structure
Rows store records about an individual item
Columns stroe attributes of the record

Columns = fields
Normalization

Flat files = a simple data structure that follows some basic organization principles


Hierarchical DB's
Consist of several related table
one table has many child tables

Organization chart is an example
Part diagram is another example

Limitations: DB's cant model complex relationships


Relational DB's
Follows structure of the flat file tables
Adds relationships between multiple tables
No restriction on the number of parent and child connections

Common keys:
social secutiry number
book isbn
upc barcode
bank account number

Fundamentals:
Data types
Constraints (Unique, check, default, Not null, PK, FK)
REFENTIAL INTEGRITY: Ensures that related data exists in a parent able before allowing an entry into a child table

BUILDING YOUR SERVER

sERVE = RUN ON PHYSICAL OR VIRTUAL MACHINES
CAN INCLUDE MULITPLE INSTANCES OF THE DBMS

Fast and read writes to disk
multicore processors
faste network connections
Lots of installed memory
