UNDERSTANDING DATA STORAGE MODELS

DB's are at the core of our modern technologyAre highly structures data files
allowed data input, organization and retrieval

DB management system
Program that allow the manipulation of DB's

DBMS
Structural rules
Data entry
Data protection

Retrieving data
Create one or more indexes to the data
Query the data in flexible ways (sort, filter, summarize and organize)


Flat file DB's
2 dimensional tables
made up of rows and columns
tipically stored in text files

Flat File structure
Rows store records about an individual item
Columns stroe attributes of the record

Columns = fields
Normalization

Flat files = a simple data structure that follows some basic organization principles


Hierarchical DB's
Consist of several related table
one table has many child tables

Organization chart is an example
Part diagram is another example

Limitations: DB's cant model complex relationships


Relational DB's
Follows structure of the flat file tables
Adds relationships between multiple tables
No restriction on the number of parent and child connections

Common keys:
social secutiry number
book isbn
upc barcode
bank account number

Fundamentals:
Data types
Constraints (Unique, check, default, Not null, PK, FK)
REFENTIAL INTEGRITY: Ensures that related data exists in a parent able before allowing an entry into a child table

BUILDING YOUR SERVER

sERVE = RUN ON PHYSICAL OR VIRTUAL MACHINES
CAN INCLUDE MULITPLE INSTANCES OF THE DBMS

Fast and read writes to disk
multicore processors
faste network connections
Lots of installed memory

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNDERSTANDING DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE (DDL)

Transact SQL
1) Data definition language (DDL)
2) Data manipulation language (DML)

DDL:
USE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE AND DELETE

Syntax conventions:
* Case insensitive
* Write keywords uppercase letters
* White-space insensitive
* Use statement terminator (;)

Comments
-- Comment
/* Comment */

Intellisense
Code hinting pop-ups
Suggest object names
higlihts or duplicate name
To refresh cache make with Ctrl+Shift+R

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNDERSTANDING DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE

DML
ADD, MODIFY, QUERY OR REMOVE data from a DB

DML Statemente
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE

Transactions
Everything succedds or nothing succeeds
If an error is generated during the operation, the DB rolls back to its prior state

WHERE clause
Applies a criteria that must be met
Limits changes to specific targeted records

Use AS to return columns of a DB with a differente name
SELECT Item AS [Producto Name]
FROM ProductListing

DELETE is more flexible than DROP or TRUNCATE


Merging data tables
Compares contents vs 2 tables and update, insert and many other
using those elements

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNDERSTANDING RELATIONSHIPS

Types of relationships
One to one
One to many
Many to many

One to one:
Created between primary keys of two tables

One to many:
One table can reference to multiple values of anothe table

Many to many:
Registry will appear multiple times in other tables


CONSTRAINTS = Conditions

Adding indexes to table
Speed up search

Naming conventions
* Avoid spaces an special characters 
* Use PascalCase or camelCase
* Use plural or singular, dont combine
* Dont use reserved words

Table name should be consistent and logic


Schemas
dbo
use to organize tables
group tables to each group it belongs to it
