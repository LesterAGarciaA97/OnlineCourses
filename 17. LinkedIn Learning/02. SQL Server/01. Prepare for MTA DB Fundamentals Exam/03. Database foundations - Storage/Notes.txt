Why normalize a table?

Isolates information so it appears in the DB only one time
Simplifies maintenance and update
Prevents inconsistencies

Normal forms
1NF: Eliminate repeating groups
2NF: Eliminate redundant data
3NF: Eliminate columns not dependent on key field
4NF: Isolate independent multiple relationships
5NF: Isolate semantically related multiple relationships

1NF:
Ensures records are in a entity format by:
* Establishing a primary identifier
* Removing multivalued attributes

2NF:
Requires first normal form
Removes redundant data and moves it into related tables

Fixing partial dependencies
Create independent tables

3NF:
Requires second normal form
Removes transiively dependent data thar does not depend on the key


4NF:
Isolate independent multiple relationships

5NF:
Isolate semantically related multiple relationships


Key fields
Types of primaty key
* Serial number
* Auto-generated identity identifier
* Naturally occurring identifier


Clustered indexes
Speed up seraches by organizing records in a logical way

B-Tree sctructure

Clustered index
Primary index of the table and defines how thre records are stored on disk

Index overload
Indexes take time to write, and must be updated every time a new record is added to the DB

Non-clustered index
Contains key values that point to the clustered index position of a record

If a clustered index does not exist, then the non-clustered index will
create pointers to the rowÂ´s location in the record heap
