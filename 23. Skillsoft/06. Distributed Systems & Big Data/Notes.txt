Basic types
Sharding
Master slave
Peer to peer
Combined


Sharding
Horizontal partition
Separete Nodes
	Read and write
Latency


Master slave
Data replication
Multiple nodes

Master node
Update data

Other nodes
queries

Scalability
Read vs write

Peer to peer
Data replication
Multiple nodes
No master

Nodes
