Packet tracer - Finding and deploying devices

Since Packet Tracer simulates networks and network traffic, the physical aspects of these networks also needs to be simulated. This includes actually finding and deploying physical devices, 
customizing those devices, and cabling those devices. After the physical deployment and cabling is done, then it is time for  configuration of the interfaces used to connect the devices.

Finding a device to deploy requires looking in the Device-Type Selection Box. The Device-Type Selection Box works on the concept of categories and sub-categories as shown in the figure.

The top row of icons represents the category list consisting of: [Networking Devices], [End Devices], [Components], [Connections], [Miscellaneous], and [Multiuser]. Each category contains 
at least one sub-category group.
