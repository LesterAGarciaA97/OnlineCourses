Packet tracer file types

Packet Tracer has the ability to create three different types of files. These file types are used for different purposes and include: .pkt, .pkz, and .pka.

The .pkt file type is used when a simulated network is built in Packet Tracer and saved. The .pkt file can also have backgrounds embedded within it.

The .pkz file type is not used very often. It is a compressed file that allows the inclusion of other files, such as .pdf files, along with the Packet Tracer files.

The .pka file type is a Packet Tracer Activity file. This file type contains a Packet Tracer activity plus an instruction window. The instructions provide a walkthrough of the necessary 
processes required to complete the activity, assignment, or assessment. The instruction window also contains a completion percentage to track how much of the activity has been 
successfully completed. There is also a Check Results feature that can be configured to provide feedback.
