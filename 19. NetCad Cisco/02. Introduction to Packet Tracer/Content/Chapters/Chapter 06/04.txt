Registering devices to a dedicated registration server



IoT devices can also be registered to a dedicated Registration Server for remote monitoring, configuration, or programming. The dedicated registration server has the benefit of being able 
to provide many other services to your network, such as Web, DHCP, DNS, email, and FTP.

With a dedicated server, IoT devices would first be connected to a wireless network and would then be configured to register to the server.

To connect and configure the registration server:

• Connect the server to your network using a wired or wireless connection.

• Click on the server and select Desktop/IP configuration. Ensure that DHCP has been turned on and then verify that the server is obtaining an IP addresse.

• Select Services/IoT and turn the Registration Server on.

To configure a remote device to interact with the registration server:

• Connect a remote device such as a tablet, PC, or smart phone to the wireless network.

• Click on the remote device and select Desktop/Web Browser. Use the IP address of the registration server as the URL.

• The first time you access the server, you will have to create a user login. Subsequent visits will require you to login using the login credentials. For security reasons, it is 
important to protect your IoT devices by using strong passwords on your server.

To register IoT devices with the Dedicated Server:

• Click on each device and select the Config tab.

• Select the remote server option under IoT server and supply the IP address of the server, plus the login information.

• Use the remote device to verify the presence of the registered IoT devices.
