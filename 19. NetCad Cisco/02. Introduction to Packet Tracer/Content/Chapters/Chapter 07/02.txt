Environment controls available in packet tracer



In the Physical Workspace there are containers. Each container, the intercity, city, buildings, and wiring closets, all have their own set of environmental values. There are 24 default 
environmental elements, such as temperature, rain, water level, wind speed, and snow. Many devices or Things affect or respond to the environment in some way. A Fire Sprinkler will raise 
the water level and humidity in a container. An old car will increase various gases and ambient temperature when turned on. A smoke detector can be used to trigger an alarm when the smoke 
in environment increases to a certain point.

If there are no devices configured to affect the environment, their values are looped on a 24-hour cycle. For example, the sun will come up at 6am and set at 6pm. The ambient temperature 
will peak at 25Â°C at noon. This cycle is set on the intercity level and its ambient temperature range will propagate all the way down to the main wiring closet automatically. If a heater 
is added to the Corporate Office and turned on, the temperature inside the Corporate Office will increase along with all the containers within it.

Note however, the heater does not heat up the parent container, Home City, it will only heat up the child containers.

When the heater is turned off, the Corporate Office will eventually converge to the parent container's ambient temperature, Home City, based on its transference value. Different 
containers may have different levels of insulation and thus different transference values; the transference values determine the rate that the child container converges with the parent 
container and works the same way for all environment types.
