Configuring the environment using containers


Important terms and concepts:

• Current time – time inside a container that increments by 30 minute increments. Every 1 second in real time equates to 30 minutes in “Container” time. The timer goes from 0 (midnight) 
to 11:59. (Figure 1)

• KeyFrame – represents a single moment in time

• KeyFrame graph – A graph that shows the value of environmental elements at any given point in time throughout the day. (Figure 2)

• Transference - values that determine the rate that the child container converges with the parent container and works the same way for all environment types.

To modify environmental elements within a container:

1. Select Environmental from the top right hand corner of the Physical view.

2. Select the appropriate container location.

3. Modify the time, if required.

4. Select Environmental Values/Edit – a keyframe graph will appear.

5. Select the Advanced tab and modify the required environmental conditions using the dropdown boxes as required.

Note: Remember to hit enter after modifying a value to add that value. (Figure 3)

6. The modified values will be reflected immediately in the keyframe graph.

7. You can also manipulate the graph by dragging the timeline to modify the time and value of a particular environmental value.
