Packet tracer user interface



Packet Tracer is a tool that allows you to simulate real networks. It provides three main menus that allow you to:

    add devices and connect them via cables or wireless

    select, delete, inspect, label, and group components within your network

    manage your network

The network management menu allows you to:

    open an existing/sample network

    save your current network

    modify your user profile or your preferences

If you have used any program such as a word processor or spreadsheet, you are already familiar with the File menu commands located in the top menu bar. The Open, Save, Save As, and Exit 
commands work as they would for any program, but there are two commands that are special to Packet Tracer.

The Open Samples command will display a directory of prebuilt examples of features and configurations of various network and Internet of Things devices included within Packet Tracer.

The Exit and Logout command will remove the registration information for this copy of Packet Tracer and require the next user of this copy of Packet Tracer to do the login procedure again.
