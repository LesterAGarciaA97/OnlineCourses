Packet tracer - GUI and CLI configuration

For intermediate devices such as routers and switches, there are two methods of configuration available. Devices can be configured or investigated via a Config tab (a GUI interface) or a 
command line interface (CLI) (Figure 1). The Config tab does not exist in most physical equipment. This tab is a learning tab in Packet Tracer. If you don’t know how to use the command line
interface, this tab provides a way to “fill in the blank” to do basic configurations. It will show the equivalent CLI commands that would do the same thing if using the Command Line 
Interface. The CLI interface requires knowledge of device configuration.

For some of the end devices, such as PCs and laptops, Packet Tracer provides a desktop interface that gives you access to IP configuration, wireless configuration, a command prompt, a Web 
browser, and much more (Figure 2).

If you are configuring a server, the server has all of the functions of the Host with the addition of one more tab, the services tab (Figure 3). This tab allows a server to be configured 
as a web server, a DHCP server, a DNS server, or various other servers visible in the graphic.
