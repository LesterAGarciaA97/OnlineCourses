Image Classification with CNNs using Keras Project

Now, we will build a CNN model and train it to solve an image classification problem. In this hands on project, you will go through the following tasks:

    Importing Libraries
    Processing the Data
    Visualize Examples
    Create Model
    Train the Model
    Final Predictions

While you are watching the instructions, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed and you will be able to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks.
