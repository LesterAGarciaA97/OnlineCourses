Practical Introduction to the Command Line

Now we will learn how to use the command line. By the end of the project we'll have photos organised into albums by date. We will accomplish it in by completing each task in the project:

    Task 1: Terminal, Bash, Command Line and Prompt
    Task 2: Execute Commands and Escape
    Task 3: Navigate and Explore
    Task 4: Create Files and Directories
    Task 5: Write, Read and Concatenate
    Task 6: Options and Chaining Commands with Pipes
    Task 7: Copy, Move and Remove Files

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. 
After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
