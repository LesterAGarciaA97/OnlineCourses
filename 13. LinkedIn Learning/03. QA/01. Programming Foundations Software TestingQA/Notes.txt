Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Quality software in minor time

6 parts:
PLAN
DEFINE
DESIGN
BUILD
TEST
DEPLOY

PLAN
Identify risk
Identify use cases

DEFINE
Write specs and acceptance criteria
Decide what's in scope
Write test strategy and test scenarios

DESIGN
Solidify test scenarios
Get feedback on scenarios from team
Manual and automation tests

TEST
Manual and automation tests
Accepting

DEPLOY
Validate functionality
Release
Test in production

TEAMS = BETTER UNDERSTANGING

Developer

SET EXPECTATIONS AND GOALS


TEST STRATEGY

Scenario
Expected result
Latest result
Automated


Acceptance Criteria (AC)
Conditions that a software product must satisfy to be
accepted by a stakeholder
Look and function


Model testing as a box

BLACKBOX TESTING
WHITEBOX TESTING
GRAYBOX TESTING

Identify test scenarios before testing
Identify both typical and nontypical use cases

INTEGRATION TESTING
another perspective
interaction between components
Integrations testing = gray box testing

Performance testing = black box testing
	Load testing
	Endurance testing = Workloads
	Stress testing = measure stability

COMMON PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS:
* long load time
* Poor scalability
* Bottlenecking

SECURITY TESTING
Exposes problems in the app that can cause 
unexpected behavior or crashes

COMMON HACKER ATTACKS
* SQL Injection
* Denial of service (DoS)


BOX TESTING
MANUAL TESTING
UI automation testing
