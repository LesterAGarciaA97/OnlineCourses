   Relational Model

Relational model is the blue print for making a DB

Tables a related via common columns
Every table has to be related to at least another table

Many to Many relationships
Use a "bridge table"
Some time called Insertion Table
The bridge tables attributes are de PK from the tables
with N:N relationship
They are primary keys in this table as well
The bridge talbe is ALWAYS the "many" side when adding connectors
