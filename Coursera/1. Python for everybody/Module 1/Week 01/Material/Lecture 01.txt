Reading: Welcome to The Class

Welcome to Getting Started with Python, the first class in our Python for Everybody Specialization. 
We have built this class specifically for those with no prior programming experience. With a relatively simple book, 
and basic exercises that focus on the core concepts of programming, we hope that you will gain a solid understanding of the 
topics in this course and be well prepared to take the rest of the courses in the specialization.

We expect that someone who knows another programming language and is just trying to learn Python should be able to go through 
the material in this class in 2-3 weeks, while someone with no programming will take 5-6 weeks. Please take your time and learn 
these concepts well, as there is little value rushing towards the later classes without proper preparation.

We keep this first section as a source of course-wide material so you can come back and reference it as you need to throughout the class.
