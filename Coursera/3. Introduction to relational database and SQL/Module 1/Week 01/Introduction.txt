Introduction to Relational Database and SQL

Now we will build a billing report and a club member roster. We will accomplish it in by completing each task in the project:

    Introduction
    Know what tables are and write basic SELECT statements.
    Use wildcard characters for pattern matching, and sort query results
    Add data to a database with INSERT statements
    Delete data from a database with DELETE statements
    Join tables together to produce meaningful reports

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the 
instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning.
